#-------------------------------- Redis Module -------------------------------
- module: redis

  enabled: true
  period: 10s

  # Redis hosts
  hosts: ["http://127.0.0.1:6379"]

  # Timeout after which time a metricset should return an error
  # Timeout is by default defined as period, as a fetch of a metricset
  # should never take longer then period, as otherwise calls can pile up.
  timeout: 1s

  # Optional fields to be added to each event
  #fields:
  #  datacenter: west

  # Network type to be used for redis connection. Default: tcp
  network: tcp

  # Max number of concurrent connections. Default: 10
  #maxconn: 10

  # Filters can be used to reduce the number of fields sent.
  #filters:
  # - include_fields:
  #     fields: ["stats"]

  # Redis AUTH password. Empty by default.
  #password: foobared


#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields, and
# add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:


# Redis

- drop_fields:
   fields: [""]
